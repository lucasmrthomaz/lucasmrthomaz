# ✨ Hi, I'm Thomaz!
## Full Software Engineer

    Desktop / Web + Mobile / IoT
    Qualified in low-level programming near bare metal (C-like)

👀 I'm passionate about technology and have a broad interest in various languages and frameworks, including C#/Java, JS/TS, Rust/Ruby/Go, Python, and Dart/Flutter.

💡 One of my main goals is to provide high-level interoperability tools that make life easier across platforms like .NET/Mono, Rust, Python, and the GraalVM Runtime—leveraging the full performance of Java/Kotlin.

🚀 I have acquired knowledge in .NET MAUI, Web3 (IPFS), NLP (Natural Language Processing), compiler-related technologies such as LLVM, AST, CST, Linker, IL, Bytecode, as well as HyperV/KVM/QEMU/Docker-K8S.

💞️ I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on open-source projects. I love contributing to open-source!
